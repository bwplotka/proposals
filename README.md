> Demo of the simplest proposal repository for design docs (e.g. for Prometheus)

Design docs do not always reflect exactly what has been implemented, and implementation details might have changed since a feature was merged. Design docs are not considered documentation and can not define a standard. Instead, it should explain the motivation, scope, the decision made and alternatives considered.

Process TBD (see [the proposal](2022-11-23_proposal-process.md)).
